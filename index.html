					<p class = "hover-text"> <b> We officially founded the FreshCare company on 15th of March 2016. 
					The 15th of March is a special date for us as we were both born on that day. 
					Our headquarters is in Castelbuono, a small village near Palermo where we come from. 
					We decided not to move from our homeland because we wanted to give value to it: in fact, Castelbuono is famous for its agricultural tradition, which includes the production of essential oils, aromatic herbs and natural cosmetic products. 
					Luce’s expertise in marketing has been crucial in building our brand, while Carlotta’s role in product development ensures that we continue to innovate and create high-quality hair care solutions that align with our botanical roots. 
					Together, we’ve built Freshcare into a company that reflects our passion, our heritage, and our commitment to excellence.

					<p class = "p2"> <b>
						Alessandra and Emanuele are friends since they were kids and both their parents often took them to the Orto Botanico dell’Università di Palermo. 
						They were completely amazed by the smell of flowers and the beauty nature could offer.  
						Years later, they began studying the beneficial properties of local vegetation on their own, especially how natural ingredients could promote health and well-being. 
						But curiosity alone wasn’t enough, we wanted to deepen our understanding and make a real impact. 
						At university, Emanuele pursued a degree in agri-food sciences, while Alessandra specialized in chemistry. It was during this time that they discovered the potential of botanical extracts for hair care. 
						The idea of creating products that combined scientific knowledge with the purity of nature really excited them. They started our artisanal production at home as a hobby, the first products served as experiments, when they saw that they worked we started giving them as gifts to relatives and friends, and then they liked them so much that the word spread and people from the town started asking us to sell our products to them as gift boxes. 
						Then they officially founded the FreshCare company on 15th of March 2016.

        	<div class = "text"> Ever since we started inventing products in our little lab at home, up until now, we have always deeply cared about being able to offer people something that would not only benefit them, but also that wouldn’t harm the planet or other living forms. 
		
		Because of that it is important to us that our products are always 100% vegan, organic, natural, gluten free and cruelty free. 
		We want to be an accessible brand for every different skin type or for people who have different allergies (if you have requests for products we still haven’t created you can always write to us and we will try to work on them).
		Because we don’t want to produce something that would harm the environment, we put special care also in the production of our packagings. We avoid plastic or anything non-eco-friendly and we use glass, recycled paper, bioplastic derived from corn starch and even labels with vegetable-based inks. 
		Because we’ve always wanted to guarantee our customers the best of quality and wanted them to trust us fully, it was really important to us to get a Natrue certification. It took some time and it was definitely not an easy route, but we finally made it this year. 
		We are very proud of this achievement because it gives us the opportunity to offer not only quality but also transparency. </div>
